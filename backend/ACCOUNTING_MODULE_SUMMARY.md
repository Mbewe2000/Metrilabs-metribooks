## 📊 ZRA Compliance Implementation

### **2025 Turnover Tax Rules**
```python
# Threshold: K1,000 monthly
MONTHLY_THRESHOLD = Decimal('1000.00')

# Rate: 5% on excess
TAX_RATE = Decimal('0.05')

# Annual limit: K5,000,000
ANNUAL_TURNOVER_LIMIT = Decimal('5000000.00')

# Calculation Example:
# Revenue: K8,000
# Taxable: K8,000 - K1,000 = K7,000
# Tax Due: K7,000 × 5% = K350
```

### **Automatic Compliance Checking**
- Monthly turnover accumulation
- Annual limit verification
- Eligibility status tracking
- Threshold-based calculations

---

## 🔄 Automatic Integration

### **Sales Integration**
```python
# When a sale is created/updated:
1. IncomeRecord created automatically
2. TurnoverTaxRecord updated for the month
3. FinancialSummary recalculated
4. All calculations respect user isolation
```

### **Services Integration**
```python
# When a service record is created:
1. IncomeRecord created automatically
2. Source marked as 'services'
3. Same tax and summary updates as sales
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### **Key Relationships**
```sql
-- User isolation across all models
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES auth_user(id)

-- Category relationships
FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES accounting_expensecategory(id)
FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES accounting_assetcategory(id)

-- Unique constraints for data integrity
UNIQUE (user_id, year, month) -- TurnoverTaxRecord, FinancialSummary
UNIQUE (user_id, sku) -- For any future product integrations
```
